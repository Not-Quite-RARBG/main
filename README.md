Continuing the legacy of the original RARBG, Not Quite RARBG aims to provide a comprehensive collection of torrents for movies, TV shows, anime, software, and games, following the unfortunate shutdown of the original site. Our goal is to offer the same level of quality and variety that made RARBG the greatest of all time.

## About Not Quite RARBG
The purpose of this website is to fill the void left by the closure of the original RARBG. We strive to gather all existing RARBG torrents for various categories, including movies, TV shows, anime, software, and games. Once we have achieved this goal, we plan to open registrations, allowing users to upload their own torrents. However, to ensure the safety of our users, all uploads will be subject to strict moderation to prevent the distribution of malware.

## Join the Community
We understand the strong nostalgia and longing for the original RARBG within the community. We invite you to join our Divolt server and be a part of the revival of RARBG. Together, we can recreate the spirit and experience that made it so beloved.
